            <p>These are the most important new features of the memoQ 8 Adriatic release.</p>

                </MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                    <p>When you receive an updated document, you will need to update its translation, too. When you do that, you usually pre-translate the new document from your translation memories or LiveDocs corpora.</p>
                    <p>You will receive a lot of fuzzy matches - with various match rates. Different match rates may need different treatment. For example, a match of 95% to 99% is almost an exact match: the text is the same, the difference is in the numbers, tags, punctuation marks, capitalization, and spaces. On the other hand, a match with a rate of 75% and below may require a lot of work - that match rate usually means a difference of more than two words in the source text.</p>
                    <p>You may want to go over the difficult matches first, and then go on to the easier ones - or the other way round. With memoQ Adriatic, this is easy because you can filter your documents for specific match rates - more precisely, for a range of match rates.</p>
                    <p>Previously, you could only search for unconfirmed fuzzy matches - or exact or context matches, and that was it. In memoQ Adriatic, you can say the match rate. You can look for or filter for segments with a match rate from 85% to 94%.</p>
                    <p>To filter the document in the translation editor:</p>

                    <p>If you receive work from a company that uses Language Terminal, they will give you a user name and a password that you can use to log in to Language Terminal.</p>
                    <p class="p_Tip"><b>If you do not use Language Terminal as an individual:</b> You may save this user name and password in memoQ. Use the <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\language-terminal-account-wizard.html">Language Terminal account wizard</a></span> to do this.
                    </p>
                    <p>You can <a href="..\Places\check-out-online-project.html">check out projects</a> from this company's memoQ server in the usual way.

                    <p>To ensure proper billing and that you do not receive work with unrealistic deadlines: You can set your availability on a calendar, and you can also log the hours - if you do work that is billed by the hour. You can do this in Language Terminal, not memoQ. Here is how:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Log in to <a href="https://languageterminal.com" target="_blank">Language Terminal</a> with the user name and password that the company gave you.<p class="p_Tip"><b>If you are also using Language Terminal as an individual:</b> Open the web browser with an incognito window.</p></li>

                        <li>To set availability for a day: Point the mouse to a day that is in the future. Click the <span class="f_Command">Settings</span> <img alt="" src="../Images/i-l/icon-lt-settings.png" /> icon. The Set capacity window appears. You can set the number of hours you can work, or take away hours for weekly events, or indicate a holiday, or indicate a recurring overtime. Make your choice, and click <span class="f_Command">Save</span>.</li>
                        <li>To log hours for a day: Point the mouse to a day that is in the <em>past</em>. Click the <span class="f_Command">Log time</span> <img alt="" src="../Images/i-l/icon-log-hours.png" /> icon.

                <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                    <p>You may have translated a Microsoft Word document in the past. When this document gets edited, you can easily translate the new, edited version.</p>
                    <p>To do this:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Create or open a project. In <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\project-home.html">Project home</a></span>, choose <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\project-home-translations-tpro.html">Translations</a></span>.</li>
                        <li>Import the edited version of the document. Use <span class="f_Command">Import with options</span>. In the <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\microsoft-word-2007-and-higher.html">Document import settings</a></span> window, click <span class="f_Command">Track changes</span>. Click the <span class="f_Command">Import changes as such</span> radio button.</li>
                        <li><a href="..\Places\translation-editor.html">Open the document for editing</a>. The tracked changes will appear in the source segments:<p><img alt="" src="../Images/t-z/translation-editor-tracked-source.png" /></p></li>
                        <li>In the <a href="..\Places\translation-editor.html">translation editor</a>, watch the <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\translation-results-list.html">Translation results</a></span> list for translation memory matches. If you are using the same <a href="..\Places\project-home-translation-memories.html">translation memory</a> that you used for the previous version, you will get so-called TC (tracked-changes) matches:<p><img alt="" src="../Images/t-z/tc-match.png" /></p></li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>A TC match is an exact match or a context match for the unedited version of the source segment. memoQ looks up the segment as if all changes were rejected - practically, this means matches for the previous version of the document. Because you have already translated that version, you will get exact matches here.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>When you insert a TC match in the <a href="..\Places\translation-editor.html">translation editor</a>, it will show a match rate for the <em>edited</em> version. That is, memoQ compares the edited version of the segment with the unedited version, and use the similarity as the match rate. This is to give you an idea of how much you need to work on the edited segment.<p><img alt="" src="../Images/t-z/tc-matches-in-grid.png" /></p><p class="p_Tip"><b>To learn more:</b> See <a href="..\Places\the-grid.html#tcmatches">Help about the Grid</a>.</p></li>
                    </ol>
                    <p class="p_Tip"><b>You can get analysis about the matches for change-tracked segments:</b> To learn more, see Help about the <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\tracked-changes-analysis-report.html">Tracked changes analysis report</a></span> window.

                    <p>Working as a reviewer in the <a href="..\Places\translation-editor.html">translation editor</a>, you can track your changes in memoQ, and you do not have to create a new document version for that.</p>
                    <p><b>To turn on tracking changes:</b> On the <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\ribbons-review.html">Review</a></span> ribbon, click <span class="f_Command">Track changes</span>.</p>
                    <p>When you edit the document, memoQ will show insertions, changes, and deletions, more or less in the same way as Microsoft Word.</p>
                    <p>
                        <img alt="" src="../Images/t-z/tracked-changes-everywhere.png" />
                    </p>
                    <p>When you turn on tracking changes, memoQ will show the markup. However, you can view the final version only. On the <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\ribbons-review.html">Review</a></span> ribbon, click <span class="f_Command">Show changes</span>. From the menu, choose <span class="f_Command">Final version</span>.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>memoQ will save the changes in the documents. Each change is marked with the name of the user who made the change, and the time when the change was made. To see the details of a change, point the mouse at it:</p>

                    </p>
                    <p class="p_Tip"><b>Markup is exported in certain formats only:</b> In most document formats, memoQ cannot export the markup. But if the document is <a href="..\Places\microsoft-word-2007-and-higher.html">Microsoft Word</a>, you can export the tracked changes. You can also export them in <a href="..\Places\sdlxliff-files.html">SDLXLIFF documents</a>, and into <a href="..\Places\bilingual-export-wizard.html">multi-column RTF documents</a>, too.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p_Tip"><b>You may not be able to track changes in online projects:</b> The project manager can set up the project so that tracking changes is not allowed. If you work on the <a href="..\Places\check-out-online-project.html">checkout of an online project</a>, and the Track changes button is not active - and you think it should be -, ask your project manager if this is intentional.
                    </p>
                    <p>When you export the document in a multi-column RTF file - it is a bilingual document format -, memoQ will export the tracked changes in the source and in the target text. If you open the document in Microsoft Word, these will show up as tracked changes in Word, too.</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                    <p>Some documents are very tightly regulated. They are written with strict version control, with every bit of change clearly marked up. When you translate these documents, you need to translate the unedited version, <em>plus</em> every tracked change as it is.</p>
                    <p>In memoQ, the way to do this is the following:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Import the documents without the tracked changes - as if all changes were rejected. You can do this with Word documents, and you need to <a href="..\Places\microsoft-word-2007-and-higher.html">import them with options</a>.</li>
                        <li>Translate the document, and confirm every segment in a translation memory.</li>
                        <li>Import the document again, this time with the tracked changes. Again, you can do this with Word documents, and you need to <a href="..\Places\microsoft-word-2007-and-higher.html">import them with options</a>.</li>
                        <li>Use the TC matches from the previous translation, and insert the changes one by one (sorry, there is no simpler way to do this). Usually, you need to copy the name of the author along with the change.</li>
                        <li>Before you do it, skim through the document, and get a list of authors who inserted changes - list at least those who inserted a lot of changes. To get the author of a change, point the mouse at the change.</li>
                        <li>Work on the changes inserted by one author at a time. Return to <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\project-home.html">Project home</a></span>, and choose <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\project-home-settings.html">Settings</a></span> (do not close the <a href="..\Places\translation-editor.html">translation editor</a>). Click the <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\project-home-settings-general.html">General</a></span> tab. In the <span class="f_Command">User name</span> box, enter the name of the first author.</li>
                        <li>Return to the document, and translate the changes of this author. When you finish, go back to <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\project-home-settings-general.html">Project home</a></span>, and enter the name of the second author. Translate the changes of that author as well.</li>
                        <li>Repeat this until all changes are translated. Finally, change the <span class="f_Command">User name</span> box back to your own name.<p class="p_Tip"><b>This works in local projects only:</b> When you work on the <a href="..\Places\check-out-online-project.html">checkout of an online project</a>, you cannot change your name.

                <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                    <p>The translation editor has new compare boxes for fuzzy matches. This makes it easier to spot editor's changes where the wording may be different but the translation does not need to change.</p>
                    <p>For example, when the editor changes <em>'the user's role'</em> into <em>'the role of the user'</em> (or vice versa), you will get a fuzzy match, most likely with a match rate below 80%. The compare boxes will highlight this for you in <em>one place,</em> so that you can immediately recognize that you do not have to touch the translation.</p>
                    <p>The trick is that the colors that used to mark the differences were replaced with - track changes markup; the same kind that appears when there are tracked changes in the <a href="..\Places\translation-editor.html">translation editor</a>. in the <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\translation-results-list.html">Translation results</a></span> pane, when you select a fuzzy match (from a translation memory or from a LiveDocs corpus), these three boxes appear:</p>
                    <p>
                        <img alt="" src="../Images/0-c/compare-control.png" />
                    </p>
                    <p>These <em>compare boxes</em> show:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>first, the current source segment;</li>
                        <li>second, the source text from the selected suggestion;</li>
                        <li>third, the target text from the selected suggestion.<p>The differences between the two source segments appear as <em>tracked changes</em> - the same way as tracked changes appear in the text. </p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The changes are highlighted in the second box only, as if the translation memory match were corrected into the current source segment. This means the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>New parts that are there in the current source segment appear as <em>inserted;</em></li>
                        <li>Old parts that appear in the match (only) appear as <em>deleted.</em><p class="p_Tip"><b>To change the color of the markup:</b> Open the <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\customize-appearance-translation-editor.html">Customize appearance</a></span> window, click the <span class="f_Command">Tracked changes</span> tab, and change the colors for the <span class="f_Command">1st author</span>.</p></li>

                    <p>The <span class="f_Command">memoQ pseudo-translation</span> plugin works like a machine-translation plugin, but it does not translate text. It simulates translation.</p>
                    <p>Pseudo-translation is useful in software localization. You can create "translation" that is visibly different from the source text. This makes it easier to spot those source strings that were not imported for translation. </p>
                    <p>Pseudo-translation is also useful for checking if the translation will fit the available space. You can add more characters to the output, or double some characters. This helps you simulate a situation when the translation becomes longer than the source text.</p>
                    <p>Pseudo-translation can also be helpful if you want to test if your document exports. You may have used a complicated filter to import your document, and in order to simulate the export of the fully translated document, you can use the pseudo-translation plugin. This prevents you from trouble of not being able to export your final files.</p>
                    <p>In memoQ 8, you can have several different pseudo-translation configurations - practically, you can have one for each language pair.</p>
                    <p>In addition, memoQ can now change the length of the segments in a controlled way - you specify how much.</p>
                    <p>Pseudo-translation works when you turn on the <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\pseudo-translation-plugin-sett.html">memoQ pseudo-translation plugin</a></span> under <span class="f_Command"><a href="https://help.memoq.com/8/en/options-machine-translation.html">Machine translation</a></span> (in <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\options.html">Options</a></span>), and you turn on <span class="f_Command">Machine translation</span> when you <a href="..\Places\pre-translate-and-statistics.html">pre-translate</a> documents.</p>

                    <p>With memoQ 8, organizations can have their profiles on <a href="https://languageterminal.com" target="_blank">Language Terminal</a>. (Before the Adriatic release, it was available to individual translators only.)</p>
                    <p>In a Language Terminal profile, organizations can do the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Keep a record of the members of the organization. You can list administrators, project managers, internal vendors (translators and reviewers), and external translators.</li>
                        <li>Keep a record of online projects. More specifically, you can track the cost and the progress of each project, and have cumulative reports about them (from Language Terminal).</li>
                        <li>See the availability of translators and reviewers: When you assign work to translators and reviewers, you can check how busy they are - so that you have an idea if they can make the deadline you are about to impose on them.<p>To do this, you need to prepare organization's Language Terminal account as well as your memoQ server. Here is how:</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Convert your Language Terminal profile into an <a href="https://languageterminal.com/organization/my-profile" target="_blank">organizational view</a>, if you have not done so yet.</li>
                        <li><a href="..\Places\language-terminal-account-wizard.html">Connect your copy of memoQ to this profile</a>. At first, use an administrator's account. You will need the project manager edition of memoQ. Use the <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\language-terminal-account-wizard.html">Language Terminal account wizard</a></span>.</li>
                        <li>In <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\server-administrator.html">Server administrator</a></span>, connect your memoQ server to this same Language Terminal profile. In <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\server-administrator.html">Server administrator</a></span>, choose <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\server-administrator-language-terminal.html">Language Terminal</a></span> to do that.</li>
                        <li><a href="..\Places\merge-users.html">Synchronize the users on memoQ server</a> with the <a href="https://languageterminal.com/organization/login-settings" target="_blank">logins and vendors in the organization's Language Terminal profile</a>. Use the <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\merge-users.html">Merge users</a></span> window. At the end of the process, you will have the same users in Language Terminal and on memoQ server.</li>
                        <li>In Language Terminal, set up the list of languages and <a href="https://languageterminal.com/organization/subject-fields" target="_blank">subject fields</a> of your organization. To set up the list of subject fields, visit the <span class="f_Command"><a href="https://languageterminal.com/organization/subject-fields" target="_blank">Subject fields</a></span> page on Language Terminal. To set up the languages, <a href="https://languageterminal.com/organization/my-profile" target="_blank">edit the organization's profile</a>.</li>
                        <li>Still in Language Terminal, <a href="https://languageterminal.com/organization/prices" target="_blank">set up your pricing strategies for the costs</a>.

                    <ul>
                        <li>where memoQ knows about the costs of the project;</li>
                        <li>where you take translators and reviewers from the organization's Language Terminal profile; and</li>
                        <li>where you can see the availability of translators and reviewers.<p>To do this, you need to log on to memoQ server with a Language Terminal user name that belongs to the organization's profile, and has administrator's or project manager's privileges. (To check or change the Language Terminal user in memoQ, use the <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\language-terminal-account-wizard.html">Language Terminal account wizard</a></span>.)</p></li>
                        <li>When you <a href="..\Places\create-new-online-project-from-template.html">create an online project</a>, check the <span class="f_Command">Store job details in Language Terminal</span> check box.

                    <p>You can now archive online projects one by one from a memoQ server. Previously, you could back up local projects only (you still can), and you could back up an entire memoQ server.</p>
                    <p>When you archive an online project, memoQ server will create a copy of the project in a single archive file. The extension of the file is <span class="f_Command">.mqarch</span>.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Normally, the archive file is saved on the memoQ server itself, in a pre-set folder. (The server's administrator can set this folder in the <span class="f_Command">Deployment tool</span>.)</li>
                        <li>The archived project is removed from the list of projects.</li>
                        <li>You can view the archived projects, and restore the online projects from them if necessary.</li>
                        <li>You can also save the archived copy to your own computer.<p class="p_Tip"><b>Automatic archives:</b> memoQ server can archive projects automatically after they are wrapped up, or after all work is done on them. To set this up, open <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\server-administrator.html">Server administrator</a></span>, and choose <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\server-administrator-archiving.html">Archiving</a></span>.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The archive contains <em>everything</em> - documents, resources (translation memories etc.), user and assignment information, settings. These are all restored when you restore an archive on the server. This helps you rebuild the project and the resources if the server was reinstalled, or when you need to move to a new server.</p>
                    <p class="p_Tip"><b>memoQ will not do one thing:</b> When restoring an online project, the record on Language Terminal will not be created again, and the connection will not be restored even if the Language Terminal record is still there.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p_Tip"><b>Do not mix this with backups:</b> You <a href="..\Places\back-up-selected-projects.html">back up local projects</a> - you <a href="..\Places\memoq-archive-projects-wizard.html">archive online projects</a>. In addition, the administrator can make a backup of the entire memoQ server from the <span class="f_Command">Deployment tool</span> - but again, that is not the same as archiving projects.

                    <p>The <span class="f_Command">memoQ pseudo-translation</span> plugin works like a machine-translation plugin, but it does not translate text. It simulates translation.</p>
                    <p>Pseudo-translation is useful in software localization. You can create "translation" that is visibly different from the source text. This makes it easier to spot those source strings that were not imported for translation. </p>
                    <p>Pseudo-translation is also useful for checking if the translation will fit the available space. You can add more characters to the output, or double some characters. This helps you simulate a situation when the translation becomes longer than the source text.</p>
                    <p>Pseudo-translation can also be helpful if you want to test if your document exports. You may have used a complicated filter to import your document, and in order to simulate the export of the fully translated document, you can use the pseudo-translation plugin. This prevents you from trouble of not being able to export your final files.</p>
                    <p>In memoQ 8, you can have several different pseudo-translation configurations - practically, you can have one for each language pair.</p>
                    <p>In addition, memoQ can now change the length of the segments in a controlled way - you specify how much.</p>
                    <p>Pseudo-translation works when you turn on the <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\pseudo-translation-plugin-sett.html">memoQ pseudo-translation plugin</a></span> under <span class="f_Command"><a href="https://help.memoq.com/8/en/options-machine-translation.html">Machine translation</a></span> (in <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\options.html">Options</a></span>), and you turn on <span class="f_Command">Machine translation</span> when you <a href="..\Places\pre-translate-and-statistics.html">pre-translate</a> documents.</p>
