                <p>These are the most important new features of memoQ 8.5.</p>
                <MadCap:dropDown>
                    <MadCap:dropDownHead>
                        <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>DeepL machine translation</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>

                        <p>DeepL&#160;is the latest "big bang" in neural machine translation. Due to popular demand, we now offer <a href="../Places/deepl-mt-plugin-settings.html">an MT&#160;plugin</a> for their service. Works both in translator pro and on memoQ&#160;server.</p>

                        <p>The <a href="../Places/project-home-term-bases.html#qa">Use in QA</a> feature, introduced in version 8.4, is now also available in <a href="../Places/memoq-online-project-term-bases.html#qa">project packages</a> – just like the setting that allows treating sub-languages such as "Portuguese (Brazil)" as separate languages during term base lookup. If you disable this setting, lookup results will come from all sublanguages of the same language, as well as the main language.</p>
                        <p> On the <span class="f_Command"><a href="../Places/translation-results-list.html">Translation results</a></span> page, you can copy&#160;a term base entry's metadata from the entry details pane.</p>
                        <p>While you are <a href="../Places/edit-term-base.html">editing a term base</a>, the <span class="f_Command"><a href="../Places/term-base-properties.html">Term base properties</a></span> window appears in read-only mode.</p>

                        <p>memoQ&#160;8 changed two things that our users often rely on.&#160;One was the <a href="../Places/translation-results-list.html#compare">Compare</a>&#160;control, the region in <span class="f_Command"><a href="../Places/translation-results-list.html">Translation results</a></span> that compares source text with results coming from the TM or LiveDocs, and shows where they differ. The other was the <a href="../Places/the-grid.html#toggle-case">Toggle Case</a> feature, also known as "<span class="f_Command">Shift+F3</span>", that switches between <i>first cap</i>, <i>all caps</i> and <i>small caps</i> mode for the selected part of the target segment. Some of our users found these changes unfortunate, and wished to get back the old features. We heard their voice and now offer a choice: both are available now in their older and newer forms. As a bonus, we made improvements the older forms.</p>

                    <MadCap:dropDownHead>
                        <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Updated ZIP&#160;and SRT&#160;filters</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
                    </MadCap:dropDownHead>
                    <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                        <p>The two new filters in memoQ&#160;8.4 have just got even better! The <a href="../Places/zip-files.html">ZIP&#160;filter</a> can now import files with extensions other than .zip, and handles bigger files. Two new filter configurations are available for COTI&#160;packages. The <a href="../Places/srt-subtitles.html">SRT&#160;filter</a> offers control over the text encoding, and lets you set density limits such as words per minute.</p>

                        <p>The <a href="../memoQ-video-preview-tool/memoq-video-preview-tool.html">memoQ&#160;video preview tool</a> is a separate app that helps when you are translating video subtitles in <a href="../Places/multilingual-excel-and-delimit.html">Excel</a> or in <a href="../Places/srt-subtitles.html">.srt</a>&#160;format. It talks to memoQ,&#160;and shows exactly that part of the video that you need.</p>

                        <p>With our open-source software development kit, anyone can make their own translation previews for any particular format. If you are localizing text for phones, smart devices, car computers, etc. - or, if you are a buyer of such localization, the SDK&#160;can be a great tool for you. The <a href="../memoQ-video-preview-tool/memoq-video-preview-tool.html">memoQ&#160;video preview tool</a> is an example that shows the possibilities this SDK&#160;offers.</p>

                        <p><a href="../Things/things-s2s.html">When memoQ&#160;servers talk to each other</a>, the translator can do lookups not only in translation memories on the parent server, but also term bases.</p>

                    <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                        <p>We carried on in this field and improved the speed of some often used features like opening projects; the TM editor; the TB&#160;editor; the translation grid, the <span class="f_Command">Resolve errors and warnings</span> page, switching between pages in the <span class="f_Command"><a href="../Places/project-home.html">Project home</a></span> or <span class="f_Command"><a href="../Places/memoq-online-project.html">memoQ online project</a></span> window; and displaying various screens in the application. The performance gain depends on your hardware configuration.</p>
