                    <p>Making good software requires understanding users’ needs, behavior and challenges. The memoQ Customer Insights Program is our effort to collect quantitative and qualitative user feedback to further improve memoQ. Currently, it has two parts:</p>
                    <p>Usage data collection:&#160;When you first start memoQ&#160;8.4, you can decide if you <a href="../Places/help-us-make-memoq-better.html">allow memoQ&#160;to send us anonymous data</a> about how you use the software. </p>
                    <p>The memoQ&#160;Design Lab: Join our user community and share your opinion with us. We will invite you to participate in various surveys, usability tests and user interviews.</p>
                    <p>Learn more about the Customer Insights Program on <a href="https://www.memoq.com/en/customer-insights-program" target="_blank" title="Customer Insights Program" alt="Customer Insights Program">memoq.com</a>.</p>

                </MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                    <p>Until now, only QTerm could export or import term bases which had images. Now <a href="../Places/term-base-export-settings.html">memoQ can do that</a>, too:&#160;it puts the images and the CSV&#160;export file into a ZIP&#160;package - which you can <a href="../Places/term-base-csv-import-settings.html">import into another term base</a> in memoQ, or even in QTerm.</p>

                    <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Forbidden terms got smarter</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
                </MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                    <p>Forbidden terms are now marked in the <a href="../Places/edit-term-base.html">term base editor</a> for easy identification. They appear in red when you <a href="../Places/term-base-export-settings.html">export your term base</a> to xlsx format. This way, people working without memoQ&#160;know which terms not to use in their work. When your client validates your terminology, and you <a href="../Places/term-base-excel-import-settings.html">import the results from Excel</a>, memoQ treats terms marked in red as forbidden terms.</p>
                    <p>We also added a <a href="../Places/filtering-sorting-a-term-base.html">filter option</a> to quickly find and review forbidden terms in your memoQ term base.</p>

                </MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                    <p>Do you have term bases to enhance AutoComplete or MatchPatch? Do you see a lot of lightning icons during translation?&#160;Or need to click Ignore endlessly after a QA?&#160;From now on, you can exclude them from QA checks, and use only the term bases with terminology. Works in both <a href="../Places/project-home-term-bases.html">local</a> and <a href="../Places/memoq-online-project-term-bases.html">online</a> projects.</p>

                </MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                    <p>We redesigned the Filter field in the <a href="..\Places\term-extraction-editor.html">term extraction editor</a> to make it easier to use. Term extraction sessions are more productive now, thanks to the improved stop word lists. You can add dropped candidates to the list quicker and easier. And you will find built-in default stop word lists for five more languages!</p>

                </MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                    <p>QTerm's cleaned-up search interface now offers more efficient options with less clicking. And when you set up relationships, those are added to both terms at the same time.</p>

                </MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                    <p>No more manual unpacking and repacking:&#160;with the brand new <a href="../Places/zip-files.html">ZIP filter</a>, import files inside a ZIP&#160;package directly into memoQ. Translate video subtitles in <a href="../Places/srt-subtitles.html">SRT&#160;format</a>, seeing the time codes in the preview window. Choose the way memoQ&#160;imports automatic numbering formats from Microsoft Word's <a href="../Places/microsoft-word-doc.html">DOC</a>&#160;and <a href="../Places/microsoft-word-2007-and-higher.html">DOCX</a>&#160;files. And using the updated <a href="../Places/wpml-xliff-filter.html">WPML&#160;filter</a>, keep up with structural changes in WordPress documents.</p>
                    <p>All of these filters are available in the <span class="f_Command"><a href="../Places/document-import-options.html">Document import options</a></span> window.</p>

                </MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                    <p>If <a href="../Things/things-s2s.html">a connection is set up</a> between the memoQ&#160;servers of an enterprise and a translation company, a translator can connect to the translation company's server (the child server), and get suggestions from translation memories on the enterprise's memoQ&#160;server (the parent server). This is very useful for the enterprise, who can share their translation memories in a very secure way: by opening a single port on their firewall for the translation company. </p>

                    <p>The <span class="f_Command"><a href="../Places/task-tracker.html">Task Tracker</a></span> window now provides more details in a more consistent way.</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                    <p>We improved the speed of some often used features like opening the Dashboard, a project, or a translation document; scrolling through resources; and displaying various screens in the application. The performance gain depends on your hardware configuration.</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                    <p>Creating a backup of your memoQ Server can take a significant amount of time, especially for servers with a lot of data. In memoQ&#160;8.4, backup times can improve by up to 50% on servers with HDD&#160;data storage.</p>
