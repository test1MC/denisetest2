                    <p>When you press <span class="f_Command">Ctrl+F</span> while you work on a translation, memoQ 8.1 will give you the <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\quick-find.html">Quick find</a></span> window. You just type your search term, and press <span class="f_Command">Enter</span>. memoQ will automatically search both in the source and in the target segments, so you don't need to watch your settings all the time. Even in the <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\quick-find.html">Quick find</a></span> window, you can switch to <a href="../Places/regular-expressions.html">regular expressions</a>.</p>
                    <p>If you need more options, the old <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\advanced-find-and-replace.html">Find and replace</a></span> window is still there. It has a new name: <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\advanced-find-and-replace.html">Advanced find and replace</a></span>, and it also got prettier and easier to use. To open the <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Things\things-alignment.html">Advanced find and replace window</a></span>, press <span class="f_Command">Ctrl+F</span> <em>twice</em>.</p>
                    <p>Find and replace also has a <a href="..\Places\quick-find.html">quick version</a>: That one opens when you press <span class="f_Command">Ctrl+H</span>.

                    <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Import all flavors of PDF - use the TransPDF service</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
                </MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                    <p>memoQ can import PDF documents on its own, but it is much more efficient if you import them through the TransPDF service. Here is how you can do that:</p>
                    <p>First, you need to <a href="http://www.iceni.com/transpdf.htm" target="_blank">register with TransPDF</a>, and <a href="..\Places\transpdf-account.html">save your TransPDF details in memoQ</a>. To do that, open the <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\memoq-menu-my-memoq.html">My memoQ</a></span> page, and click <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\transpdf-account.html">My TransPDF account</a></span>.</p>
                    <p class="p_Tip"><b>You need to pay for TransPDF:</b> TransPDF is <em>not</em> free. After you register, you can produce 25 pages of translated PDF for free, but you need to pay for the rest. TransPDF will charge you after the number of the <em>final, translated pages</em> that you <em>export</em>. So, the PDF will be imported for free, and you pay when you export the finished work.
                    </p>
                    <p>After you save your TransPDF account details in memoQ, you can begin to translate PDF documents:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><a href="..\Places\create-new-project-from-template.html">Create a local </a><a href="..\Places\create-new-project-from-template.html">project</a>.</li>
                        <li>Import PDF documents using the <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\document-import-options.html">Import with options</a></span> command. In the <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\document-import-options.html">Document import options</a></span> window, click <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\document-import-settings.html">Change filter and configuration</a></span>.</li>
                        <li>In the <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\pdf-portable-document-format-files.html">Document import settings</a></span> window for the PDF documents, click the <span class="f_Command">Import through TransPDF</span> radio button. (There are no other options.) Click <span class="f_Command">OK</span> to start importing the documents. memoQ will give you a warning that it needs to send the document to TransPDF to be converted.</li>
                        <li>In the <span class="f_Command">Translations</span> pane of <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\project-home.html">Project home</a></span>, memoQ will open another tab called <span class="f_Command">TransPDF import/export</span>. This tab lists all PDF documents you are importing through TransPDF.<p><img alt="" src="../Images/t-z/transpdf-import.png" /></p></li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>In the background, memoQ will upload the PDF documents to the TransPDF service. TransPDF will convert them into XLIFF files. When this is ready, memoQ downloads the XLIFF files.</p>
                    <p>The imported files will not appear automatically in the project. Instead, memoQ will indicate on the <span class="f_Command">TransPDF import/export</span> tab when they are ready to be added to the project.</p>
                    <p>If there are other documents in your project, you can work on them while you wait for the PDF files to import. Even better, you can even close memoQ or the project - and when you open this project again, the imported PDF files will be ready for you.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>To start working on the PDF documents: Click the <span class="f_Command">TransPDF import/export</span> tab. In the row of each document, click <span class="f_Command">Add to project</span>. Now memoQ will import the XLIFF file that TransPDF made out of the original PDF.</li>
                        <li>After you translate the document, you need to export it through TransPDF again. Use the <span class="f_Command">Export (stored path)</span> command.</li>
                        <li>memoQ will add the document to the <span class="f_Command">TransPDF export/import</span> tab again, this time for exporting. memoQ will also upload the translated XLIFF file to TransPDF, and wait for the result. When TransPDF finishes processing the XLIFF document, you can save the PDF document.</li>
                        <li>In the <span class="f_Command">TransPDF export/import</span> tab, next to the finished document, click <span class="f_Command">Save</span>. You can choose from three options:<p><img alt="" src="../Images/t-z/transpdf-export.png" /></p></li>
                    </ol>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="f_Command">Preview PDF</span>: You get a PDF where each page contains detailed information about the document itself. The exported page is part of the output, but TransPDF adds a lot of extra content. You cannot send this to your client.</li>
                        <li><span class="f_Command">Comparison PDF</span>: You get a PDF where the original pages and the translated pages appear side by side. This is still not the final translated PDF that you can send to your client. memoQ may take a few minutes to produce this type of PDF.</li>
                        <li><span class="f_Command">Final PDF</span>: You get the final translated PDF.<p class="p_Tip"><b>This is when you need to pay:</b> When you download the final PDF, TransPDF will charge you for the number of pages in this PDF.</p></li>

                    <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Import tracked changes from SDLXLIFF documents and translation quality assessment from Trados Studio packages</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
                </MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                    <p>SDLXLIFF documents (that come from Trados Studio) may contain tracked changes. memoQ can import these.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>When you import an SDLXLIFF document, use the <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\document-import-options.html">Import with options</a></span> command. In the <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\document-import-options.html">Document import options</a></span> window, select the SDLXLIFF files, and click <span class="f_Command">Change filter and configuration</span>.</li>
                        <li>In the <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\sdlxliff-files.html">Document import settings</a></span> window, click the <span class="f_Command">Tracked changes</span> tab, and then click <span class="f_Command">Import change tracking information</span>.</li>
                        <li>This is when you need to decide how you want to export tracked changes: Normally, memoQ uses the options that you set in the <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\options-miscellaneous.html">Miscellaneous</a></span> pane of the <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\options.html">Options</a></span> window. However, if you want to make sure that tracked changes are exported as tracked changes, click <span class="f_Command">Export change tracking markup</span>.<p>After you import the document, you can work with tracked changes normally, just like in any other document in memoQ.</p></li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>If you receive work in a Trados Studio (SDLPPX) package, you can work with the translation quality assessment (TQA) information in the documents.</p>
                    <p>memoQ will convert the TQA feedback into its own <a href="..\Things\things-linguistic-quality-assurance.html">Linguistic Quality Assurance (LQA)</a> warnings. To do that:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The wizard you use to import the package will have a page where you can decide to import translation memories and term bases. On the same page, there is a link to <a href="..\Places\sdlxliff-files.html">customize SDLXLIFF import</a>. Click this link.</li>
                        <li>The <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\sdlxliff-files.html">Document import settings</a></span> window opens with the SDLXLIFF options. Click the <span class="f_Command">Translation quality assessment</span> tab, and click <span class="f_Command">Import quality assessment information as LQA ranges</span>.</li>
                        <li>memoQ will import the document. Segments where the original package contained TQA feedback will appear as <em>rejected</em>, and you can look at details of the warnings. <p class="p_Tip"><b>To learn more about rejecting segments and entering LQA warnings:</b> see the Help pages about the <a href="..\Places\the-grid.html">translation editor</a>, as well as the <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\enter-lqa-error.html">Enter LQA error</a></span> window.</p></li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>When you work on this document (more precisely, on this package), you may add Linguistic Quality Assurance (LQA) warnings to the documents. You need to tell memoQ how it should export these warnings. You must do this when you import the package. </p>
                    <p>If you want to send LQA warnings back to Trados Studio in the form of TQA feedback, customize the SDLXLIFF filter when you import the package. In the Document import settings window, click the Translation quality assessment tab, and check the <span class="f_Command">Export memoQ LQA information as Trados quality assessment changes</span> check box. Then, click <span class="f_Command">Export change tracking markup</span>. (The text in the window needs to be corrected.)</p>
                    <p class="p_Tip"><b>To learn more about dealing with tracked changes and TQA in Trados documents and packages:</b> See the Help pages about <a href="..\Places\import-sdl-studio-package.html">importing Trados Studio packages</a> as well as the <a href="..\Places\sdlxliff-files.html">SDLXLIFF import settings</a>.

                </MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                    <p>memoQ 8.1 uses a new method to produce the translation preview. It got much faster, and it is also a lot more robust: For example, a 250-page Word document of ca. 21 Mbytes is imported in just under a minute, complete with preview. (This happens on the fairly average 5-year-old desktop computer where this Help topic is being written.)</p>
                    <p>PowerPoint preview is back, and it is also created fast enough. However, if a PowerPoint presentation contains very large images, the View pane may be unable to display the preview.</p>
                    <p><b>You can now find text in the preview:</b> Click anywhere in the <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\the-view-pane.html">View</a></span> pane. Press <span class="f_Command">Ctrl+F</span>. In the <span class="f_Command">Find</span> box, type the words to look for. memoQ will highlight the matches, and jump to the first one. You can jump to the second, third, etc. match by clicking <span class="f_Command">Next</span>. The window stays open, so that you can jump and look for other words, too.</p>
                    <p>
                        <img alt="" src="../Images/d-h/find-in-preview.png" />
                    </p>
                    <p>This is extremely helpful if the preview contains text that does not have to be translated and is not imported in the translation grid - for example, because it was deliberately excluded (or replaced with an inline tag).</p>

                    <p>This means that memoQ is no longer restricted to 2 gigabytes in the computer's memory.</p>
                    <p>It will run in 32-bit only when the computer cannot run 64-bit programs.</p>

                    <p><b>The Google MT plugin will now use neural machine translation</b> if it is available in your language combination. This does not need further configuration. In some cases, neural machine translation can be much more fluent and human-like than statistical machine translation. To learn which language pairs are available for neural machine translation, visit this web page: <span class="f_Command"><a href="https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/languages" target="_blank">https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/languages</a></span>, and scroll down to 'Language Support for the Neural Machine Translation Model'.</p>
                    <p>The Microsoft MT plugin will also use the so-called "Neural engine". You need to ask for this in the settings of the plugin. Microsoft's DNN (Deep Neural Network) model will work if Microsoft offers neural machine translation for your language combinations. Neural machine translation provides slightly better accuracy and a more fluent translation in some cases.

Before now, only two decimal digits were allowed. So, you can specify a word rate of €15.6722 instead of just €15.67. This can make a lot of difference when a project has hundreds of thousands or millions of words.</p>
                    <p class="p_Tip"><b>If you manage online projects:</b> You can do this in online projects, too. You can specify the cost - the word or character rates - for your co-workers with up to four decimal digits, too.

                    <p>memoQ 8.1 includes the <span class="f_Command">Find and Replace</span> script. You can use this to make changes to documents <a href="..\Places\edit-template-import-export-scripting.html">before they are imported in a project</a> - or <a href="..\Places\edit-template-import-export-scripting.html">after they are exported from a project</a>. </p>
                    <p>Plus, you can use the <span class="f_Command">Find and Replace</span> script to <a href="..\Places\edit-template-running-custom-s.html">change documents while they travel through a project</a>.</p>
                    <p>(This script was written - and originally used - by our Professional Services team.)</p>
                    <p>To use this script, add it to an online project as a <a href="..\Places\edit-template-running-custom-s.html">custom automated action</a>.</p>

                    <p class="p_Tip"><b>Requires memoQ project manager:</b> You can enjoy this improvement if you use the project manager edition of memoQ and you work with online projects on a memoQ server or on a memoQ cloud subscription.

                    <p>The <a href="..\Places\dashboard-for-project-managers.html">project manager's dashboard</a> now shows when each online project was last modified. You can sort the list by this as well. See the Help topic on the <a href="..\Places\dashboard-for-project-managers.html">project manager's dashboard</a>.</p>
                    <p>In the <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\server-administrator.html">Server Administrator</a></span> - on the <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\server-administrator-archiving.html">Archiving</a></span> pane - you now can tell memoQ server to archive an online project automatically if it was not touched for a long time. The default period is a month but this is not turned on at first.
