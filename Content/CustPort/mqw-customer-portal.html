            <p>If you are sending translation requests to a provider who uses the memoQ server's Customer Portal, these pages will help you learn how to sign up for the Customer Portal, and how to send work.</p>
            <p>You can make this work in five steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="mqw-customer-portal.html/mqw-sign-up.html">Sign up for the Customer Portal</a>, and activate your access. Connect to the Customer Portal at the web address that your provider gave you. Example: <span class="f_CodeExample">https://translationcompany.com/customerportal</span>. The provider may need to approve your registration. Then, <a href="mqw-customer-portal.html/mqw-sign-in.html">sign in</a>.</li>
                <li><a href="mqw-customer-portal.html/mqw-request-quote-or-translation.html">Send in a new request for translation</a>.<p class="p_Tip"><b>You receive a quote for the request:</b> It always shows the weighted word count (the number of words that the provider bills for), and if the provider has set up prices for their services, the quote also contains a financial offer.</p></li>
                <li><a href="mqw-customer-portal.html/mqw-translation-quotes.html">Accept or reject the quote</a>. If you accept a quote, the provider will begin the translation work immediately. If you reject, it becomes <a href="mqw-customer-portal.html/mqw-cancelled-quotes.html">cancelled</a>.</li>
                <li><a href="mqw-customer-portal.html/mqw-translation-jobs-in-progress.html">Monitor the progress of your request</a>.</li>
                <li>When the translation is finished, <a href="mqw-customer-portal.html/mqw-finished-translation-jobs.html">download the translated documents</a>.<p>Most of the process is automatic, but there are steps where a project manager is involved. The provider will assign you a project manager - or a few project managers. You can <a href="mqw-customer-portal.html/mqw-people.html">contact them directly</a>.</p></li>
            </ol>
            <p>You may also need to</p>
            <ul>
                <li>see which PMs you are working with,</li>
                <li>change your Customer Portal password,</li>
                <li>or, if you are a manager of your company's Customer Portal team, make changes to the accounts of your team members.<p>All three things can be done from the Customer Portal's <span class="f_Command"><a href="mqw-customer-portal.html/mqw-people.html">People</a></span> section.</p></li>
            </ul>
