            <p>In Customer Portal's <span class="f_Command">People</span> section, you can manage contacts and accounts.</p>
            <p>Open Customer Portal in your web browser. Log in using your email and password.</p>
            <p>Click <span class="f_Command">People</span> above the menu bar at the top.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The <span class="f_Command">Contact</span> page lists all the project managers on the provider's side who are assigned to your requests. You can send them emails from here. However, when you deal with a specific translation request, use the <span class="f_Command">Contact PM</span> button or icon that belongs to that request.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The <span class="f_Command">My Account</span> page is where you change your Customer Portal password. You can also get here if you click your user name at the top right on any Customer Portal screen. Click <span class="f_Command">Save</span> to make the change or <span class="f_Command">Cancel</span> to go to the <span class="f_Command"><a href="mqw-people.html/mqw-dashboard.html">Dashboard</a></span> without changing your password.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>To access the <span class="f_Command">Team</span> page, you need to have the <span class="f_Command">Manager</span> role. On the <span class="f_Command">Team</span> page, you can see all Customer Portal contacts from your company.</p>
            <p>Click <span class="f_Command">Change role</span> to change a user's role to something else. Choose their new role and click <span class="f_Command">Apply</span>. If you click <span class="f_Command">Cancel</span>, the role will not change.</p>
            <p>Click <span class="f_Command">Reassign work</span> to assign all the user's quotes to another user. Select the new user and click <span class="f_Command">Apply</span>. If you click <span class="f_Command">Cancel</span>, the assignments will not change.</p>
            <p>To delete a user, click <span class="f_Command">Delete</span>, then click <span class="f_Command">Delete</span> again. Before you do this, you need to reassign their work to someone else.</p>
            <p>If you check the <span class="f_Command">Show deleted contacts</span> check box, your company's deleted users will appear in the list:</p>
