        <h1>Request quote or translation</h1>
        <div class="TopicContent">
            <!-- Content start -->
            <p>To send in a request for translation, you need two things:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the source documents at hand</li>
                <li>an email address and a password to access your provider's Customer Portal.<p>&#160;</p></li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
                <li>Open Customer Portal in your web browser. Log in using your email and password.</li>
                <li>The Customer Portal <span class="f_Command"><a href="mqw-request-quote-or-translation.html/mqw-dashboard.html">Dashboard</a></span> opens:<p><img alt="" src="../Images/_mqw/cpc-dashboard.png" /></p></li>
                <li>In the menu at the top, click <span class="f_Command">Request quote or translation</span>. The <span class="f_Command">Request quote or translation</span> page opens:<p><img alt="" src="../Images/_mqw/cpc-request-quote-trans.png" /></p></li>
                <li>From the <span class="f_Command">Source language</span> dropdown, choose a source language.</li>
                <li>Click the <span class="f_Command">Target languages</span> box, and click the target languages you need the translation into.</li>
                <li>From the <span class="f_Command">Type of service</span> dropdown, choose one of the services you agreed on with your provider.</li>
                <li>From the <span class="f_Command">Type of workflow</span> dropdown, choose the level of automation. Practically, you can choose from two (for the time being, the third is the same as the second):</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="f_Command">PM-created quote</span>: Your project manager will receive your request, create the project by hand, and run the analysis themselves.</li>
                    <li><span class="f_Command">Automatic quote</span>: The provider's server will automatically process your request, and produce the quote for you.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>In either case, you receive the number of weighted words - the number of words your provider will bill you. If your provider set up prices for their services, you also receive the total cost of your request.</li>
                <li>In the middle of the page, there is a box where you can drag files. You can also drag a ZIP file there - the provider's memoQ system will unzip it and import the contents. Alternatively, you can click the middle of the box: an <span class="f_Command">Open</span> window will appear where you can browse for the files to translate.</li>
                <li> In addition to the translatables, you can upload reference files for the translators. If you check the <span class="f_Command">Also upload reference files</span> check box, the file box will split into two parts:<p><img alt="" src="../Images/_mqw/cpc-request-quote-trans-with-ref.png" /></p></li>
                <li> In the <span class="f_Command">Message to project manager</span> box, type a message to the project manager. Write a phrase or two to describe the work. This appears on the list for the project manager and makes it easier for them to find the project.</li>
                <li> In the <span class="f_Command">Note to yourself</span> box at the bottom, write a word or two for yourself. This text appears on your list when you look at the requests and ongoing jobs.</li>
                <li> Choose a deadline: there are buttons for <span class="f_Command">Next working day</span>, <span class="f_Command">Three working days</span>, and <span class="f_Command">A week from today</span> - but you can also type a date or choose one from the calendar. </li>
                <li> Example:<p><img alt="" src="../Images/_mqw/cpc-request-quote-trans-filled.png" /></p></li>
                <li> To send your request to the provider, click <span class="f_Command">Start</span>.<p>When the job is sent in, Customer Portal reports success:</p></li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                <img alt="" src="../Images/_mqw/cpc-create-quote-success.png" />
            </p>
            <p>Regardless of the workflow, a quote will be prepared. You will receive an email when it is ready. Then you can view and accept it.</p>
            <p>To close this page without sending your request, click <span class="f_Command">Cancel</span>.</p>
