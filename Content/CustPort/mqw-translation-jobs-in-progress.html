            <p>After you accept a quote, your translation provider starts working on your request. On Customer Portal's main page, you can check how much they completed so far.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Open Customer Portal in your web browser.</li>
                <li>Log in using your email and password. </li>
                <li>The Customer Portal <span class="f_Command"><a href="mqw-translation-jobs-in-progress.html/mqw-dashboard.html">Dashboard</a></span> opens.</li>
                <li>Click <span class="f_Command">In progress</span> in the menu at the top. The <span class="f_Command">Translation jobs in progress</span> page opens.<p><img alt="" src="../Images/_mqw/cpc-trans-jobs-in-prog.png" /></p></li>
            </ol>
            <p>This page shows the list of translation jobs in progress.</p>
            <p>Depending on your user role in Customer Portal, you will see different things on this page. Your provider's PM can help you if you are not sure about your role.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="f_Command">Observer</span> and <span class="f_Command">Manager</span> users can see all the jobs requested by someone in their company, and use the <span class="f_Command">Select contact</span> box on the upper right to see jobs requested by a specific contact person.</li>
                <li><span class="f_Command">Requester</span> users can only see the jobs they requested. They do not have the <span class="f_Command">Select contact</span> box and the table's <span class="f_Command">Contact</span> column.<p>To quickly check a job's progress: hover your mouse pointer over its progress bar. Three percentages appear, showing progress of the <span class="f_Command">Translation</span>, <span class="f_Command">Review 1</span> and <span class="f_Command">Review 2</span> stages:</p></li>
            </ul>

            </p>
            <p>This works the same way on the <span class="f_Command"><a href="mqw-translation-jobs-in-progress.html/mqw-dashboard.html">Dashboard</a></span> and the <span class="f_Command">Translation jobs in progress</span>, <span class="f_Command">Work in progress</span> and <span class="f_Command">Progress</span> pages.</p>
            <p>To contact a PM about a job: in the <span class="f_Command">Ops</span> column, click the job's <span class="f_Command">Contact PM</span> <img alt="" src="../Images/_mqw/icon_cpc_mail.png" /> icon. Your default email app opens with the <span class="f_Command">To</span> and <span class="f_Command">Subject</span> fields already filled in (with the PM's email and the job's project ID).</p>
            <p>To see more info about a job: in the <span class="f_Command">Ops</span> column, click the job's <span class="f_Command">Details</span> <img alt="" src="../Images/_mqw/icon_cpc_details.png" /> icon. The <span class="f_Command">Work in progress</span> page opens:</p>
            <p>

                <li><b>To change the deadline:</b> Until the provider's PM accepts your deadline, you can ask to change it. Click <span class="f_Command">Request new deadline</span>.</li>
                <li><b>To see file-level progress info:</b> Click <span class="f_Command">See detailed progress</span>. The <span class="f_Command">Progress</span> page opens:<p><img alt="" src="../Images/_mqw/cpc-job-progress.png" /></p></li>
