            <!-- Content start -->
            <p>After you request a quote or a translation, your provider's project manager or your provider's server prepares a quote for you. When a quote is ready, you receive an email from Customer Portal.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Open Customer Portal in your web browser.</li>
                <li>Log in using your email and password. </li>
                <li>The Customer Portal <span class="f_Command"><a href="mqw-translation-quotes.html/mqw-dashboard.html">Dashboard</a></span> opens.</li>
                <li>Click <span class="f_Command">Quotes</span> in the menu at the top. The <span class="f_Command">Translation quotes</span> page opens.<p><img alt="" src="../Images/_mqw/cpc-trans-quotes.png" /></p></li>
            </ol>
            <p>This page shows all the quote requests waiting for approval. You can manage them here. </p>
            <p>Depending on your user role in Customer Portal, you will find various actions in the <span class="f_Command">Ops</span> column on this page. Your provider's PM can help you if you are not sure about your role.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="f_Command">Observer</span> users can see all the requests submitted by someone in their company, and use the <span class="f_Command">Select contact</span> box on the upper right to see requests sent in by a specific contact person. They can <span class="f_Command">view details</span> <img alt="" src="../Images/_mqw/icon_cpc_details.png" /> and <b>contact the PM</b> <img alt="" src="../Images/_mqw/icon_cpc_mail.png" /> about a request.</li>
                <li><span class="f_Command">Requester</span> users can only see the requests they submitted. They do not have the <span class="f_Command">Select contact</span> box and the table's <span class="f_Command">Contact</span> column. In addition to the two actions above, they can also <span class="f_Command">accept</span> <img alt="" src="../Images/_mqw/icon_cpc_accept.png" /> or <span class="f_Command">reject</span> <img alt="" src="../Images/_mqw/icon_cpc_reject.png" /> quotes.</li>
                <li><span class="f_Command">Manager</span> users have all the options listed above: they see all the quotes, can choose to filter by contacts, and all four actions are available to them.<p>The actions:</p></li>
                <li><span class="f_Command">Accept quote</span> <img alt="" src="../Images/_mqw/icon_cpc_accept.png" />: The quote is accepted and moves to the <span class="f_Command">In progress</span> list. The provider's PM gets a notification and the translation work starts. Use this if the quote is correct.</li>
                <li><span class="f_Command">Reject quote</span> <img alt="" src="../Images/_mqw/icon_cpc_reject.png" />: The quote is rejected and moves to the <span class="f_Command">Cancelled</span> list. The provider's PM gets a notification. Use this if you made a mistake in the request, or if the quote has a problem that you could not solve by contacting the PM.</li>
                <li><span class="f_Command">Contact PM</span> <img alt="" src="../Images/_mqw/icon_cpc_mail.png" />: Your default email app opens with the <span class="f_Command">To</span> and <span class="f_Command">Subject</span> fields already filled in (with the PM's email and the job's project ID). Use this if the quote has a problem that you think you can solve by contacting the PM.</li>
                <li><span class="f_Command">View details</span> <img alt="" src="../Images/_mqw/icon_cpc_details.png" />: The <span class="f_Command">Request details</span> page opens:<p><img alt="" src="../Images/_mqw/cpc-request-details.png" /></p></li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Check the word counts, the cost, and the deadline:</b> Your provider may change the deadline if the original deadline you requested is not feasible. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>If the current deadline is not suitable for you, click <span class="f_Command">Request new deadline</span>. Type the date you suggest or choose it from the calendar. To send the change request, click <span class="f_Command">Apply</span>. To leave the deadline unchanged, click <span class="f_Command">Cancel</span>.</li>
                <li>If everything is in order, click <span class="f_Command">Accept</span>.</li>
                <li>If the quote has a problem that you think you can solve by contacting the PM, click their email at the bottom of the <span class="f_Command">Quote information</span> section. Your default email app opens with the <span class="f_Command">To</span> field already filled in with the PM's email.</li>
                <li>If you made a mistake in the request, or if the quote has a problem that you could not solve by contacting the PM, click <span class="f_Command">Reject</span>.<p><b>To go to another page:</b> Click its link in the menu at the top.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>To close Customer Portal:</b> Click <span class="f_Command">Log out</span> in the top right corner.</p>
