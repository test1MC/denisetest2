            <p>Before you send requests through the Customer Portal, you need to sign up. Your provider may need to approve your registration, and then you need to activate your access.</p>
            <p>Open Customer Portal in your web browser. Your provider can give you the web address. Example: <span class="f_CodeExample">https://translationcompany.com/customerportal</span>.</p>
            <p>The <span class="f_Command"><a href="mqw-sign-up.html/mqw-sign-in.html">Sign in</a></span> page opens:</p>
            <p>
                <img alt="" src="../Images/_mqw/cpc-signin.png" />
            </p>
            <p>Click <span class="f_Command">Sign up</span>. The <span class="f_Command">Create Customer Portal account</span> page opens.</p>
            <p>
                <img alt="" src="../Images/_mqw/cpc-signup.png" />
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Enter a user name and a valid email. Make sure you can be reached at that email - that is where your activation email arrives.</li>
                <li>You will also sign in to Customer Portal with that email (not your user name).</li>
                <li>Choose a password that is at least 8 characters long, and contains lowercase and uppercase letters, plus numbers. Repeat the password.</li>
                <li>In the <span class="f_Command">Company/department</span> dropdown, choose your organization.</li>
                <li>Click <span class="f_Command">Create my account</span>.<p>The administrator of Customer Portal receives your registration request and approves it. After that, you receive an email with a link.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Click the link in the email. A new page opens in your web browser and confirms activation of your account. Click <span class="f_Command">Proceed to login page</span>.</p>
            <p>On the <span class="f_Command"><a href="mqw-sign-up.html/mqw-sign-in.html">Sign in</a></span> page, enter your email (not your user name) and password, then click <span class="f_Command">Login</span>. Customer Portal's <span class="f_Command"><a href="mqw-sign-up.html/mqw-dashboard.html">Dashboard</a></span> opens. You are ready to send in requests.</p>
