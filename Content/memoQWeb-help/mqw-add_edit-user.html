                        <p>You can add users to a memoQ server directly from memoQWeb, without opening memoQ. The memoQWeb module must be installed on memoQ server.</p>
                        <h2>How to get here</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Open memoQWeb in a Web browser. Log in as an administrator or a project manager.</li>
                            <li>Click the <span class="f_Command"><a href="mqw-admin.html">Admin</a></span> tab, then click the <span class="f_Command"><a href="mqw-users.html">Users</a></span> tab below it.</li>
                            <li>The <span class="f_Command"><a href="mqw-users.html">Users</a></span> page appears.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>To add a new user:</b> Click the <span class="f_Command">Add users</span> icon at the top of the user list.</li>
                            <li><b>To edit an existing user:</b> In the <span class="f_Command">Ops</span> column, click the <span class="f_Command">Edit</span> <img alt="" src="../Images/i-l/icon_edit.png" /> icon for the user. Or: right-click the user name, and choose <span class="f_Command">Edit</span>.<p><img alt="" src="../Images/_mqw/admin-add-user.png" /></p></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The <span class="f_Command">Add users</span> or the <span class="f_Command">Edit user</span> window appears. The two are almost the same. There is one small difference between them:</p>
                        <p>

                        <p><b>Add or edit a user</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>By default, users set their passwords for themselves. New users will receive an email with a link to memoQWeb's password form.</p>
                        <p><b>To set up the password for the new user:</b> Clear the <span class="f_Command">User will set their own password</span> check box. The <span class="f_Command">Password</span> and <span class="f_Command">Repeat password</span> boxes appear. Fill them in.</p>

                            <li><span class="f_Command">Password</span>: Enter or change the password with which this user signs in to the server. The password:</li>
                            <li>must have at least 12 characters,</li>
                            <li>must not start or end with whitespace characters,</li>
                            <li>must not contain the user name, and</li>
                            <li>must have at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one other symbol.</li>
                            <li><span class="f_Command">Repeat password</span>: Retype the password to avoid typos. This field must be the exactly same as the <span class="f_Command">Password</span> field.</li>

                        <p>In memoQ, permissions tell if a user can access a resource and what they can do with it. To make this easier, memoQ supports groups. A group is a means to treat multiple users together: if a group has access to something, all of its members do. Adding a user to a group is much simpler than changing their permissions. To improve security, admins should give permissions to groups instead of single users.</p>
                        <p>This table shows all groups:</p>
