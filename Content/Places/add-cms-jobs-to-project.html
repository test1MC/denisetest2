        <h1>Add CMS jobs to project</h1>
        <div class="TopicContent">
            <!-- Content start -->
            <p>When memoQ server receives translation jobs from a <a href="..\Places\cms-dashboard.html">content management system (CMS)</a>, the jobs are turned into <a href="..\Places\memoq-online-project.html">online projects</a>.</p>
            <p>When a job arrives, you can <a href="..\Places\create-new-online-project-from-template.html">create a new online project</a> from it. Or, memoQ server can do it automatically if it has a <a href="..\Places\cms-dashboard-workflows.html">workflow</a> in the <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\cms-dashboard.html">CMS Dashboard</a></span> that specifies the same connection and the same language combination.</p>
            <p>When there is already an online project that was created from a CMS job, and the same CMS site sends new jobs in the same language combination, you do not have to create a new project. Instead, the new jobs can be imported in an existing online project.</p>
            <p>In this window, you can choose the jobs and documents you want to import into the online project.</p>
            <p class="p_Tip"><b>Requires memoQ project manager:</b> You need to have a project manager license to use this command.
                        </p>
            <p class="p_Tip"><b>Works in CMS projects only:</b> You can use this command in projects that were created from translation jobs sent from a content management system (CMS).
                        </p>
            <h2>How to get here</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Open an <a href="..\Places\memoq-online-project.html">online project for management</a>. Choose a project that was created from a CMS translation job.</li>
                <li>On the <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\ribbons-online-project.html">Online project</a></span> ribbon, click <span class="f_Command">Add CMS Jobs</span>. The <span class="f_Command">Add CMS jobs to project</span> window opens.<p><img alt="" src="../Images/0-c/add-cms-jobs-to-project.png" /></p></li>
            </ol>
            <h2>What can you do?</h2>
            <p>Choose which jobs and documents to add to the online project. You can select several jobs. Or, you can select just a few files from a job.</p>
            <p>Find jobs where the status is <span class="f_Command">New</span>, and check their check boxes. You can select one or more jobs.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, you can process part of a job. To do that, click the arrowhead at the beginning of the row, expanding the items inside. memoQ will expand the items, first the language pairs, then the documents for each language pair:</p>
            <p>
                <img alt="" src="../Images/0-c/create-new-online-proj-template-1-cms-batchparts.png" />
            </p>
            <p>Normally, you would check the check box for the entire job (at the top), but you can pick and choose by checking the check boxes for individual language pairs or documents.</p>
            <p>To import all the jobs available, check the check box of the <em>connection</em>.</p>
            <p>Check the check boxes of the jobs, language pairs, or documents you want to add to the project.</p>
            <h2>When you finish</h2>
            <p>After you make your selection, click <span class="f_Command">Import</span>. memoQ will import the files in the project, and return to the <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\memoq-online-project.html">memoQ online project</a></span> window.</p>
            <p>If you do not want to add the CMS jobs after all, click <span class="f_Command">Cancel</span>. memoQ will not import anything, and return to the <span class="f_Command"><a href="..\Places\memoq-online-project.html">memoQ online project</a></span> window.</p>
